# menu_scroll

- **Default**: no
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_MenuScroll

When set, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If unset, the screen
is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
(useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).
