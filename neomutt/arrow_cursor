Name: arrow_cursor
Type: boolean
Default: no

When set, an arrow ("->") will be used to indicate the current entry
in menus instead of highlighting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
in the menu.
