C_Recall DT_QUAD
Default: ask-yes

Controls whether or not NeoMutt recalls postponed messages
when composing a new message.

Setting this variable to yes is not generally useful, and thus not
recommended.  Note that the <recall-message> function can be used
to manually recall postponed messages.

Also see $postponed variable.
