C_PgpClearsignCommand DT_STRING|DT_COMMAND
Default: ""

This format is used to create an old-style "clearsigned" PGP
message.  Note that the use of this format is strongly
deprecated.

This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
possible printf(3)-like sequences.
Note that in this case, %r expands to the search string, which is a list of
one or more quoted values such as email address, name, or keyid.
(PGP only)
