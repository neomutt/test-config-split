Name: sidebar_component_depth
Type: number
Default: 0

By default the sidebar will show the mailbox's path, relative to the
$folder variable. This specifies the number of parent directories to hide
from display in the sidebar. For example: If a maildir is normally
displayed in the sidebar as dir1/dir2/dir3/maildir, setting
sidebar_component_depth=2 will display it as dir3/maildir, having
truncated the 2 highest directories.
