# quit

- **Default**: yes
- **Flags**: DT_QUAD
- **Variable**: C_Quit

This variable controls whether "quit" and "exit" actually quit
from NeoMutt.  If this option is set, they do quit, if it is unset, they
have no effect, and if it is set to ask-yes or ask-no, you are
prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.
