C_AttachSplit DT_BOOL
Default: yes

If this variable is unset, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
etc) on a list of tagged attachments, NeoMutt will concatenate the
attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
$attach_sep separator is added after each attachment. When set,
NeoMutt will operate on the attachments one by one.
