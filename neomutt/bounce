C_Bounce DT_QUAD

Name: bounce
Type: quadoption
Default: ask-yes

Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
If set to yes you don't get asked if you want to bounce a
message. Setting this variable to no is not generally useful,
and thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.
