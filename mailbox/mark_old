C_MarkOld DT_BOOL

Name: mark_old
Type: boolean
Default: yes

Controls whether or not NeoMutt marks new unread
messages as old if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
With this option set, the next time you start NeoMutt, the messages
will show up with an "O" next to them in the index menu,
indicating that they are old.
