# sig_on_top

- **Default**: no
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_SigOnTop

If set, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded
text.  It is strongly recommended that you do not set this variable
unless you really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take
some heat from netiquette guardians.
