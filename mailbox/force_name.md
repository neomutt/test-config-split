# force_name

- **Default**: no
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_ForceName

This variable is similar to $save_name, except that NeoMutt will
store a copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address
you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.

Also see the $record variable.
