# help

- **Default**: yes
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_Help

When set, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.

Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while NeoMutt is
running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
of these should present a major problem.
