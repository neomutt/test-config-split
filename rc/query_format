%e      Extra information *
%n      Destination name
%t      "*" if current entry is tagged, a space otherwise
%>X     Right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
%|X     Pad to the end of the line with "X"
%*X     Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.

* = can be optionally printed if nonzero, see the $status_format documentation.
