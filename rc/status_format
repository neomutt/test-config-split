Name: status_format
Type: string
Default: "-%r-NeoMutt: %D [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"

Controls the format of the status line displayed in the "index"
menu.  This string is similar to $index_format, but has its own
set of printf(3)-like sequences:
%b      Number of mailboxes with new mail *
%d      Number of deleted messages *
%D      Description of the mailbox
%f      The full pathname of the current mailbox
%F      Number of flagged messages *
%h      Local hostname
%l      Size (in bytes) of the current mailbox (see formatstrings-size) *
%L      Size (in bytes) of the messages shown
        (i.e., which match the current limit) (see formatstrings-size) *
%m      The number of messages in the mailbox *
%M      The number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit) *
%n      Number of new messages in the mailbox *
%o      Number of old unread messages *
%p      Number of postponed messages *
%P      Percentage of the way through the index
%r      Modified/read-only/won't-write/attach-message indicator,
        According to $status_chars
%R      Number of read messages *
%s      Current sorting mode ($sort)
%S      Current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)
%t      Number of tagged messages *
%u      Number of unread messages *
%v      NeoMutt version string
%V      Currently active limit pattern, if any *
%>X     Right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
%|X     Pad to the end of the line with "X"
%*X     Soft-fill with character "X" as pad

For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.

* = can be optionally printed if nonzero

Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
of the above sequences, the following construct is used:

%?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?

where sequence_char is a character from the table above, and
optional_string is the string you would like printed if
sequence_char is nonzero.  optional_string may contain
other sequences as well as normal text, but you may not nest
optional strings.

Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
new messages in a mailbox:

%?n?%n new messages.?

You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:

%?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?

If the value of sequence_char is non-zero, if_string will
be expanded, otherwise else_string will be expanded.

You can force the result of any printf(3)-like sequence to be lowercase
by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore ("_") sign.
For example, if you want to display the local hostname in lowercase,
you would use: "%_h".

If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (":") character, NeoMutt
will replace any dots in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful
with IMAP folders that don't like dots in folder names.
