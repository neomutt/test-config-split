# bounce

- **Default**: ask-yes
- **Flags**: DT_QUAD
- **Variable**: C_Bounce

Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
If set to yes you don't get asked if you want to bounce a
message. Setting this variable to no is not generally useful,
and thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.
