C_MailCheckStats DT_BOOL

Name: mail_check_stats
Type: boolean
Default: no

When set, NeoMutt will periodically calculate message
statistics of a mailbox while polling for new mail.  It will
check for unread, flagged, and total message counts.  Because
this operation is more performance intensive, it defaults to
unset, and has a separate option, $mail_check_stats_interval, to
control how often to update these counts.

Message statistics can also be explicitly calculated by invoking the
<check-stats> function.
