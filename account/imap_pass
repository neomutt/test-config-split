C_ImapPass DT_STRING|DT_SENSITIVE

Name: imap_pass
Type: string
Default: ""

Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If unset, NeoMutt will
prompt you for your password when you invoke the <imap-fetch-mail> function
or try to open an IMAP folder.

Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your neomuttrc even
if you are the only one who can read the file.
