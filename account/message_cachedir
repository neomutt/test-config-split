C_MessageCachedir DT_STRING|DT_PATH

Name: message_cachedir
Type: path
Default: ""

Set this to a directory and NeoMutt will cache copies of messages from
your IMAP and POP servers here. You are free to remove entries at any
time.

When setting this variable to a directory, NeoMutt needs to fetch every
remote message only once and can perform regular expression searches
as fast as for local folders.

Also see the $message_cache_clean variable.
