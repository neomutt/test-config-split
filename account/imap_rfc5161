C_ImapRfc5161 DT_BOOL

Name: imap_rfc5161
Type: boolean
Default: yes

When set, NeoMutt will use the IMAP ENABLE extension (RFC 5161) to
select CAPABILITIES. Some servers (notably Coremail System IMap Server) do
not properly respond to ENABLE commands, which might cause NeoMutt to hang.
If your connection seems to freeze at login, try unsetting this. See also
