# crypt_timestamp

- **Default**: yes
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_CryptTimestamp

If set, NeoMutt will include a time stamp in the lines surrounding
PGP or S/MIME output, so spoofing such lines is more difficult.
If you are using colors to mark these lines, and rely on these,
you may unset this setting.
