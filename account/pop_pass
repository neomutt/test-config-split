C_PopPass DT_STRING|DT_SENSITIVE

Name: pop_pass
Type: string
Default: ""

Specifies the password for your POP account.  If unset, NeoMutt will
prompt you for your password when you open a POP mailbox.

Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your neomuttrc
even if you are the only one who can read the file.
