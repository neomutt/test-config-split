C_IncludeEncrypted DT_BOOL
Default: no

Controls whether or not NeoMutt includes separately encrypted attachment
contents when replying.

This variable was added to prevent accidental exposure of encrypted
contents when replying to an attacker.  If a previously encrypted message
were attached by the attacker, they could trick an unwary recipient into
decrypting and including the message in their reply.
