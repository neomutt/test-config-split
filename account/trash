Name: trash
Type: path
Default: ""

If set, this variable specifies the path of the trash folder where the
mails marked for deletion will be moved, instead of being irremediably
purged.

NOTE: When you delete a message in the trash folder, it is really
deleted, so that you have a way to clean the trash.
