C_SaveEmpty DT_BOOL
Default: yes

When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed
when closed (the exception is $spoolfile which is never removed).
If set, mailboxes are never removed.

Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, NeoMutt does not
delete MH and Maildir directories.
