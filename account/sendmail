C_Sendmail DT_STRING|DT_COMMAND
Default: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"

Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by NeoMutt.
NeoMutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
arguments as recipient addresses.  NeoMutt appends all recipients after
adding a -- delimiter (if not already present).  Additional
flags, such as for $use_8bitmime, $use_envelope_from,
$dsn_notify, or $dsn_return will be added before the delimiter.

See also: $write_bcc.
