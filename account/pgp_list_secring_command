C_PgpListSecringCommand DT_STRING|DT_COMMAND

Name: pgp_list_secring_command
Type: command
Default: ""

This command is used to list the secret key ring's contents.  The
output format must be analogous to the one used by:
gpg --list-keys --with-colons --with-fingerprint

Note: gpg's fixed-list-mode option should not be used.  It
produces a different date format which may result in NeoMutt showing
incorrect key generation dates.

This is a format string, see the $pgp_decode_command command for
possible printf(3)-like sequences.
(PGP only)
