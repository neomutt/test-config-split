# virtual_spoolfile

- **Default**: no
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_VirtualSpoolfile

When set, NeoMutt will use the first defined virtual mailbox (see
virtual-mailboxes) as a spool file.
This command is now unnecessary. $spoolfile has been extended to support
mailbox descriptions as a value.
