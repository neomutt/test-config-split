C_ImapQresync DT_BOOL

Name: imap_qresync
Type: boolean
Default: no

When set, NeoMutt will use the QRESYNC extension (RFC 7162)
if advertised by the server.  NeoMutt's current implementation is basic,
used only for initial message fetching and flag updates.

Note: this feature is currently experimental.  If you experience
strange behavior, such as duplicate or missing messages please
file a bug report to let us know.
