C_ImapFetchChunkSize DT_LONG|DT_NOT_NEGATIVE
Default: 0

When set to a value greater than 0, new headers will be downloaded
in sets of this size.  If you have a very large mailbox, this might
prevent a timeout and disconnect when opening the mailbox, by sending
a FETCH per set of this size instead of a single FETCH for all new
headers.
