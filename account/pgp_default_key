Name: pgp_default_key
Type: string
Default: ""

This is the default key-pair to use for PGP operations.  It will be
used for encryption (see $postpone_encrypt and $pgp_self_encrypt).

It will also be used for signing unless $pgp_sign_as is set.

The (now deprecated) pgp_self_encrypt_as is an alias for this
variable, and should no longer be used.
(PGP only)
