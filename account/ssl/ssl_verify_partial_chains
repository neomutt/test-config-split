C_SslVerifyPartialChains DT_BOOL
Default: no

This option should not be changed from the default unless you understand
what you are doing.

Setting this variable to yes will permit verifying partial
certification chains, i. e. a certificate chain where not the root,
but an intermediate certificate CA, or the host certificate, are
marked trusted (in $certificate_file), without marking the root
signing CA as trusted.

(OpenSSL 1.0.2b and newer only).
