# crypt_confirmhook

- **Default**: yes
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_CryptConfirmhook

If set, then you will be prompted for confirmation of keys when using
the crypt-hook command.  If unset, no such confirmation prompt will
be presented.  This is generally considered unsafe, especially where
typos are concerned.
