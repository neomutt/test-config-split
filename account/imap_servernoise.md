# imap_servernoise

- **Default**: yes
- **Flags**: DT_BOOL
- **Variable**: C_ImapServernoise

When set, NeoMutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
server as error messages. Since these messages are often
harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
them at some point.
